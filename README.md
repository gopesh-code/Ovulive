## Project Overview

Olive (Ovulive) is a multi-functional platform focusing on a holistic approach in female healthcare. It is estimated that females make up about 49.58% of the world population, and it is crucial to take precautions to shield the reproductive health against infections, damage, and issues, including specific long-term health issues. The aim of Olive is to provide a solution in the form of an app, by creating a platform that will provide the following:

- Period Tracking
- Intake of pills, contraceptives
- Note-taking
- Forums for chatting
- Blogs
- Health monitoring and vitals monitoring for all
- Other Menstrual needs
- Negative side effects monitoring, and support
- Live doctor/psychologist recommendations
- Real-time data visuals

## Problem Statement

Menstrual tracking is an important aspect of women's health, but many women do not have access to a reliable and user-friendly tracking solution. Olive aims to develop a mobile application that provides not only menstrual tracking, but also other features to support women's health, such as blogs, analytics, and a pill reminder.

## Scope of the Project

Addresses a real need: Menstrual health is an important aspect of women's health, and many women experience difficulties managing their menstrual cycle and related health issues. This project provides a solution to this problem by providing an application that helps women track their menstrual cycle and provides access to educational resources and support to help manage related health issues.

Utilizes technology to solve a problem: Technology can be used to improve people's lives in many ways, and this project is a prime example of that. The application provides a convenient and accessible way for women to track and manage their menstrual health, and the blogs and forums provide a platform for women to connect with others and access helpful information and support.

Combines multiple functions: The multifunctional nature of Olive allows women to track their menstrual cycle and manage their health, as well as connect with others and access helpful resources, all in one place.

## Tools/Software

- React Native: An open-source framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- Node.js and npm: JavaScript runtime environment and a package manager for Node.js.
- React Native CLI: Command-line interface for React Native development.
- Code Editor: For writing and editing the source code of your React Native app. Examples: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text.
- Android Studio or Xcode: IDEs for developing and testing Android and iOS apps.
- Firebase or another backend service: For storing and retrieving data.
- Charting libraries: To display menstrual cycle data. Examples: react-native-chart-kit, react-native-charts-wrapper, react-native-highcharts.
- Device sensors and APIs: For tracking menstrual health data.
- Test devices: Smartphones or tablets running Android or iOS.

## Progress Status

**Project** | **Status** | **Notes**
--- | --- | ---
Project Title and Purpose | `Completed` | The idea suggested by Gopesh and after consideration along with a discussion on the topic and also comparing the 2 ideas that were presented, we moved on with this one and concluded to move ahead with the next part of the process.
Research | `Launched` | All members will be researching various already deployed applications which would help in building the general concept and functionalities the app would need. Also, what features users will be expecting from Ovulive. Not only this but the drawbacks which other apps already have will be discussed and tried to resolve.
Features/Functionalities | `Launched` | All the features we require in the app, are put forward by all the members of the group, and implementation of the same is discussed. This is a research-oriented process and would be completed as the project moves ahead.
Design and Layout | `Planning` | The General UI/UX layout will be created once the functionalities are finalized, Angela along with Shruti will work on a suitable UI design for a cross-platform application (Android & IOS).
Website | `Yet to negin` | Nithin would be focusing on the initial website which would display the idea and concept of the application and then the deployment would be aided by Gopesh and Adam.
Front-End Development | `Not Started` | Once all the features/functionalities and requirements are discussed and finalized, Angela, Adam, Gopesh, Nithin, Shruti will be working on the front end (Client-side) of the application to complete each page of the application. This part of the project should take around 25 days – 1.5 months (depending on the functionalities).
Back-End Development | `Not Started` | Gopesh and Adam will work on the back-end (server-side) part of the project which will span over a month and a half. Apart from this, setting up the database would be Nithin, Gopesh, and Adam’s part.
Testing | `Not Started` | To be started once the application is deployed.

## Technical Details

The app will be based primarily on Android given that iOS already has its own health app which has multiple features within itself, but the overall idea will be based on improving those features and bringing in better novelties into the product, and then creating an iOS alternative for the same. For the tech stack, the team will be trying to create a cross-platform app through React Native or Xamarin, or Flutter, depending on the complexities of the functionalities of the application. Figma and Adobe XD will be used for prototyping and initial display. The expected completion time for the project is 3.5-4.5 months with most of the functionalities expected to be fulfilled.
