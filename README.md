Olive (Ovulive) - A multi-functional platform focusing on a holistic approach in female healthcare.

## Project Overview

Olive (Ovulive) is a multi-functional platform focusing on a holistic approach in female healthcare. It is estimated that females make up about 49.58% of the world population, and it is crucial to take precautions to shield the reproductive health against infections, damage, and issues, including specific long-term health issues. The aim of Olive is to provide a solution in the form of an app, by creating a platform that will provide the following:

- Period Tracking
- Intake of pills, contraceptives
- Note-taking
- Forums for chatting
- Blogs
- Health monitoring and vitals monitoring for all
- Other Menstrual needs
- Negative side effects monitoring, and support
- Live doctor/psychologist recommendations
- Real-time data visuals

## Problem Statement

Menstrual tracking is an important aspect of women's health, but many women do not have access to a reliable and user-friendly tracking solution. Olive aims to develop a mobile application that provides not only menstrual tracking, but also other features to support women's health, such as blogs, analytics, and a pill reminder.

## Scope of the Project

Addresses a real need: Menstrual health is an important aspect of women's health, and many women experience difficulties managing their menstrual cycle and related health issues. This project provides a solution to this problem by providing an application that helps women track their menstrual cycle and provides access to educational resources and support to help manage related health issues.

Utilizes technology to solve a problem: Technology can be used to improve people's lives in many ways, and this project is a prime example of that. The application provides a convenient and accessible way for women to track and manage their menstrual health, and the blogs and forums provide a platform for women to connect with others and access helpful information and support.

Combines multiple functions: The multifunctional nature of Olive allows women to track their menstrual cycle and manage their health, as well as connect with others and access helpful resources, all in one place.
